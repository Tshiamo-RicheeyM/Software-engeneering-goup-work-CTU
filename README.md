# Real Company - Business Registration Website  

## *About the Project*  
This is a simple project for a business registration website. The idea is to help people register their businesses easily without all the complicated paperwork. It’s a basic site with different pages explaining what we do and how we can help.  

## *What’s Inside?*  
- *Home Page:* A quick intro to the site and what it’s about.  
- *About Page:* Some background on the company (or just placeholder text for now).  
- *Services Page:* Details on how we help with business registration.  
- *Portfolio Page:* A section to show off businesses we’ve helped (for now, just an idea).  
- *Blog Page:* Space for business tips and news.  
- *Contact Page:* A simple form to reach out for more info.  

## *Tech Used*  
- *HTML & CSS* (for the structure and styling)  
- *JavaScript* (for some animations and interactivity)  
- *PHP (Planned)* to handle forms and backend stuff later  

## *How to Run It*  
1. Download or clone the repo.  
2. Open index.html in a browser.  
3. Make sure all CSS and JS files are linked properly.  

## *Author*  
Made by *Tshiamo, Kitso, Mokgadi, Tshimologo, Zama, Lwazi and Jason* for a student project. Nothing too fancy, just learning and building cool stuff!
